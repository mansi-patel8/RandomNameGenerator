# Random Name Generator

This program will generate n random names for a character of some game or a novel. 
To do this, you need to access three files: firstnames.txt, lastnames.txt, prefixes.txt, postfixes.txt.
These files are provided with the project and have 20 lines each, for simplicity. 

## Concept Focus
```bash
- This program focuses on how to work with different files, arrays and random numbers.
```
## Installation/Prerequisite

```bash
1. You will need header file for random number generation and coin_flip and some other functions.
2. You will need firstnames,lastnames, postfixes and prefixes files for random name options.
```

## Program Description

```bash
- This program will generate n random names for a character of some game or a novel. 
  To do this, you need to access three files: firstnames.txt, lastnames.txt, prefixes.txt, postfixes.txt.
  These files are provided with the project and have 20 lines each, for simplicity. 
  - Make sure to ask the user for a number of names to generate. 
    The typical random name should look like this:
		Prefix (space) Firstname (space) Lastname , Postfix
	- So, each time you want to generate a name, you get a random number line from 1 to 20 and get a name part from that line. 
    Do this for all name parts, then concatenate them to get a full name and display it to the user. 
    There should be a 50% chance to NOT generate a prefix, postfix or both. Make sure to display all generated names to the user in an orderly fashion.
  Note:  Since gender is a concept highly argued today, the random names may be controversial and ridiculous, which just adds some fun to it.
